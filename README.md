PyGame pool simulator with a single ball, useful to explore Kalman Filtering ideas and algorithms.

The filter tracks the ball in real-time. When the PyGame window is closed, a performance review is shown.
The filter parameters are fully customizable.
The simulation is stoppable and steppable, so you can appreciate the filter in action.
